# Randomly Adding Anything

## Why is this?

After a while, Minecraft's boundaries are massive. From surviving to fighting, from exploring to building to travelling across dimensions; Minecraft has many things and the only thing limiting you is your imagination.
However, once you learn it, it becomes kind of the same every time; always mine the same minerals, with always the same tools, always the same biomes.

This mod turns Minecraft back to that unexplored place that we once loved to learn to play and were afraid to explore!

## Features

### Randomize Ores!

When the mod is initially installed, it will create a new set of minerals and gems.
Each one of these ores are randomly colorized and generated.
These minerals can be found anywhere like sand or gravel, not only stone!
Each mineral has it's uses, and some are better than others in some situations.

## FAQ

#### Q: How do I re-randomize ores?

A: In the configs folder there is a `raa.json5` document. If you set the `"regen"` property to `true`, new ores will generate each time you boot up minecraft until that setting is turned back to `false`.

**TL;DR** Set `.minecraft/config/raa.json5`'s `"regen"` to `true` until you get whatever ores you like.

#### Q: Is there any way I can suggest my ideas or anythying of the sort? Is there a chat?

A: Yes, there is! The team has a Discord server that you can join through this link: https://discord.gg/t4Tbm7r. _Remember to be respectful and read the rules~_

#### Q: AAAAA I FOUND A BUG, How do I report it?

A: You have two options. If the bug seems like something minor and doesn't heavily impact gameplay, you may want to ask in the Discord Server first! (#raa-mod-talk or #raa-brainstorming).

However, if the bug causes a crash or heavily impacts gameplay, you should post an issue that contains:

- Operative System (Commonly Windows)
- Minecraft Console Log

The contents of these files:
- config/raa.json5
- config/raa/materials/materials_0.json
- config/raa/dimensions/dimensions_0.json
- config/raa/entities/entities_0.json
